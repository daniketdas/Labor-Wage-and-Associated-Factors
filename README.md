# daniketdas-Labor-Wage-and-Associated-Factors
In this project, I delved into the intricate relationship between labour wages and various influencing factors. The objective was to comprehensively analyse the determinants that impact wages across different industries and demographics. By examining this multifaceted landscape, we aimed to gain valuable insights into the dynamics of labour compensation and its implications for workforce management, economic policies, and social equity. This is a study where we will see the association between labour wage and other factors (usual working hour, total experience and tenure) based on the data of 2246 females taken from 1988 survey. After building up the econometric model and running regression the result, we got that among the 3 independent variables only 2 variables (hours and ttl_exp) are statistically significant as they have “P>|t|” values less than 0.05 or they do not have 0 in their confidence interval and we also got R-square term to be 0.0799. So, in this study we interpreted all these results and discussed about limitations of this study. Keywords: [wage, total hours, total experience, tenure].
